# Machine-Learning - Implementing some algorithms from scratch. Also shows in-depth analysis of PCA and LCA as an algorithm and not a feature extraction process. 

-Implement core ML algorithms including Linear and Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- Train ML algorithms with a training set and validation set (if necessary).
- Use ML algorithms to do regression and classiâ€‚cation.
- Evaluate the quality of an ML algorithm
- Decide on the most applicable ML algorithm
- Can normalize data and project to lower and higher dimensional space as necessary.
