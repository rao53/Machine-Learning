CODE
- There is no extra work required in running the code. Every block of code is clearly explained and you simply need to just run it. One thing to note is that the accuracy for LDA from skLearn is somewhat different from the one I got from my implementation. I however could not figure out where I might have gone wrong with it. 

FINAL PAPER
- The instructions stated for it to be 3 pages. It should be noted that the methodology extended the number of pages given I had to paste screenshots of my derivation of all equations. 

PRESENTATION
- To listen to the presentation, simply go to the slide show tab and play the slideshow from start. It should also be noted that every single page has it's own voice over and can be listened to by simply clicking on "play from current slide"
